## Possible Improvements
Here are some possible improvements that can be made to the project:

### 1. API Testing Using MSW
Implement API testing using Mock Service Worker (MSW). MSW allows you to mock API requests and responses, making it easier to test components that rely on external APIs.

### 2. Implement Store Testing with Proper Mocking of Redux Store
Enhance the testing of Redux store by properly mocking the Redux store. This will ensure that the state management logic is thoroughly tested and behaves as expected.

### 3. Coverage of the Test Case for the Project
Improve the test coverage for the project by writing additional test cases. Ensure that all components, hooks, and utility functions are covered by tests to maintain high code quality and reliability.

### 4. Implement BlurHash Using react-blurhash Library for Better UX
Implement BlurHash using the react-blurhash library to improve the user experience. BlurHash provides a way to display a blurred preview of an image while it is loading, enhancing the visual appeal and perceived performance of the application.
